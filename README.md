🤖 AI Coding Assistant
An intelligent assistant designed to simplify programming by offering real-time help on coding queries, giving precise answers, and generating code snippets to boost productivity. This assistant uses a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to analyze code files (.py, .c, .cpp, etc.) and answer questions based on the actual code content.

Key Features
✅ Code-based Answers: Provides context-aware responses by examining and understanding the code in your files.
❓ Programming-Specific Q&A: Restricted to only programming-related questions, delivering expert responses on various programming languages.
📜 Embedded RAG Model: Integrates a hybrid RAG model for storing and retrieving detailed programming knowledge from custom file inputs.
🔍 Advanced Search and Recall: Uses Redis for efficient data retrieval and OpenAI embeddings for relevance ranking.
🧩 Interactive Console: Simple and interactive user interface powered by Streamlit for ease of use.
Technologies Used
🤖 OpenAI's gpt-4o for natural language understanding and response generation.
⚙️ text-embedding-3-small for code and query embeddings.
🧩 Streamlit for the front-end interface.
📅 Redis for quick, indexed access to knowledge base entries.
🐍 Python for core application logic.
